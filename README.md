The theme used for this project is "The Elders Scroll".


# Project Goal

The project Goal was to improve my algorithms and technologies skills with **ReactJS** and **Java** with **Spring framework** using **Websockets**. 

# Project ressources

 - I used free graphics ressources found on google and
   the map used for the game has been found on
   **[@Tank_At](https://github.com/TankAT/TheElderRisk)** Github who have made this great SVG.

- And for ReactJS ressources used mainly an open source component that handle Websockets [@lahsivjar](https://github.com/lahsivjar/spring-websocket-template)
